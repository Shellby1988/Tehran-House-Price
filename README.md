Tehran House Price Prediction Project
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project that predicts house prices in Tehran using data collected from the Divar app.

Project Overview
In this project, we aimed to predict house prices in Tehran by leveraging machine learning techniques. The project involved the following key steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to understand the features and relationships within the data.

Outlier Detection and Removal: Identified and removed outliers to ensure the modelâ€™s robustness and accuracy.

Data Preprocessing:

Used Robust Scaler to scale anomalous data and handle outliers effectively.
Model Selection:

Utilized PyCaret to automate the machine learning workflow and find the best regression model for predicting house prices.
Employed Bayesian Ridge regression for the final prediction model.
Results
Test Score (R-squared): 0.8832699211613886
Mean Squared Error: 0.08266659062128451
